In case you are having problems with using the program, please have a look at the troubleshooting chapter</p> What types of chronicles / game systems are supported at the moment? <p>At the moment the chronicles for Pathfinder 2 and Starfinder are supported. Pathfinder 1 is in general also possible, but I did not yet have time to provide the proper configuration. Also Pathfinder 1 may take some more time, as Paizo seems to have changed the chronicle layout between editions.</p> What about scenario-specific options? For example, I have this one scenario where I need an easy way to strike out boons that the group did not get. <p>The program already supports in general to have scenario-specific options, and there are already templates for some scenarios. However, neither do I own all Society scenarios nor do I have enough time to provide the config for multiple dozens of scenarios that I own. But... contributions are welcome! No programming skills are required for providing a scenario-specific config. Just a text editor and some time to fiddle out the coordinates for all the relevant parts. And what do I also have on the roadmap? An auto-updater for such configs! So if people would contribute scenario-specific configs, then other people don't need to update their installation of pfscf every two weeks, but just call the program with some yet-to-be-determined parameter (think of <code>pfscf update-config</code>) and you get the latest and greatest scenario-specific config automatically downloaded to your computer.</p> I have this absolutely great idea for a missing feature! Can you implement this? <p>Yay! Feature ideas are always welcome! Please open an issue in this repository and describe your idea! The more details, the better! But please be also aware that I am doing this in my free time, and some things might be really, really complicated to realize. So please don't be mad if things might take a little bit longer or sometimes even won't be done. But... it's open source, contributions are always possible and welcome :) Still: If you have an idea that you think would improve this project, please create an issue here. You'll never know unless you tried!</p> Why don't you also provide the blank chronicles? <p>Should probably be clear, but let's have that question anyways. The answer is: Copyright. I do not own the blank chronicles and don't have permission from Paizo to include them here. I also won't take up any discussions with Paizo regarding this. If you want to fill out chronicles, you should have the scenario PDF anyways.</p> Will there ever be a GUI for pfscf? <p>Quite unlikely, at least not by me. I suck at GUIs and am also not that interested in having one for pfscf (although I also see the advantages). But if you're interested in making one and using pfscf in the background, then I'm sure that lots of people will love it! Honestly! It's just not something for me, sorry.</p> Can you provide this program also for additional operating systems? <p>I can in general provide prebuild binaries for all operating systems and platforms that are supported by Golang. This includes especially intel 32bit, arm, and PowerPC. So if you think there is a need for this, please drop me a message.</p> <p>(PS: Android is also supported by golang, but as this is a command-line tool I currently do not see the point of providing an Android build.)</p> Why golang? <p>It produces standalone executables for all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and users do not have to install any additional software to use pfscf. Also I wanted to give golang a try anyways (first go project for me), and then it's always good to have something that you plan to use yourself.</p>"},{"location":"installation/","title":"Installation &amp; Updates","text":""},{"location":"installation/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>You can download the latest release from the \"Assets\" section of the latest release.

You can then manage, e.g. the Y coordinates in a single preset that is used by all entries on the same line.</p> <p>Presets are structured in a more or less similar way as \"regular\" content entries, i.e. the list of supported fields is a subset of what is presented in section Generic Content Entry Structure. Presets can be used by content entries or by other presets. To use a preset, it has to be listed in the <code>presets</code> section of a content entry or another preset entry.</p> <pre><code>content:\nname:\n[...]\npresets: [ topline ]\n</code></pre> Presets Example  Example structure: <pre><code>presets:\ndefaultfont:\nfont: Helvetica\nfontsize: 14\ntopline:\ny:  10\ny2: 12\npresets: [ defaultfont ]\ncontents:\nname:\ntype: textCell\nx:  20\nx2: 27.5\npresets: [ topline ]\n</code></pre>  Resulting content: <pre><code>contents:\nname:\ntype: textCell\nx:  20\ny:  10 # from preset 'topline'\nx2: 27.5\ny2: 12 # from preset 'topline'\nfont: Helvetica  # from template 'defaultfont', indirectly inherited via 'topline'\nfontsize: 14     # from template 'defaultfont', indirectly inherited via 'topline'\n</code></pre> <p>It is possible to use multiple presets at the same time.</p> <pre><code>content:\nname:\n[...]\npresets: [ topline, boldfont ]\n</code></pre> <p>But this will only work as long as the presets are \"compatible\" to each other, i.e. as long as they do not contain any conflicting information. So it is not possible to use two presets in the same content entry where one of them says that, e.g., the <code>y2</code> coordinate has a value of 100, and the other presets states that <code>y2</code> should be 105.</p> Presets Conflict Example  Example structure: <pre><code>presets:\npresetX:\nx: 50\n\npresetCoords_1:\ny: 10\npresets: [ presetX ]\n\npresetCoords_2:\ny: 12\npresets: [ presetX ]\n\ncontents:\nsomeEntry_1:\ntype: textCell\nx: 10\npresets: [ presetCoords_1 ]  # Only one preset used; original 'x' takes precedence, everything ok\n\nsomeEntry_2:\ntype: textCell\npresets: [ presetCoords_1, presetCoords_2 ] # Conflict!

There are currently three options for the <code>pfscf fill</code> command to support finding the correct coordinates:</p> <ul> <li><code>--cellBorder</code> (short: <code>-c</code>)</li> <li><code>--exampleValues</code> (short: <code>-e</code>)</li> <li><code>--grid</code> (short: <code>-g</code>)</li> </ul> <p>The <code>grid</code> option is probably the most useful. It will draw a grid over the chronicle PDF file and print the x/y coordinates at the borders of the page. The grid consists of major lines every 5 percent and minor lines every percent. This should allow to get at least the rough coordinates for whatever you want to add, although normally some fine-tuning is required afterwards.</p> <p>Next is the <code>cellBorder</code> option. When this is selected, <code>pfscf</code> will draw borders around the cells that it is printing on the page. This allows to see the exact boundaries and locations of what you provided via coordinates. At the moment, this is only done for content that is actually printed to the page. So if you have some new content, but do not print it on the page, there won't be any borders displayed as well.</p> <p>And finally the <code>exampleValues</code> option. If you select this, normal input values like, e.g. <code>player=Bob</code> will be ignored. Instead, every content that has an <code>example</code> value provided will be printed to the chronicle using exactly this value.</p> <p>So from experience I would suggest to start with the <code>grid</code> option, get rough initial coordinates, and then switch to using both the <code>cellBorder</code> option and the <code>exampleValues</code> option to fine-tune everything.</p>"},{"location":"templates/#other-formatting-options","title":"Other Formatting Options","text":""},{"location":"templates/#text-alignment","title":"Text Alignment","text":"<p>Some content types, e.g. <code>textCell</code>, allow to choose an alignment.

To fix this, I would propose to first have a look at section Getting Blank Chronicle Sheets and follow the steps described there to see if that helps. If this does not help, lets see if the following does:</p> <p>First, execute the following command:</p> <pre><code>$ pfscf fill &lt;your_scenario_id&gt; &lt;your_blank_chronicle.pdf&gt; output.pdf -d -e\n</code></pre> <p>Now you should have file <code>output.pdf</code> with some example value and some green boxes. There is one large box in the middle that covers nearly all of the content. In the lower right corner of this green box it says <code>main</code> in green letters. If everything would be correct, then it would be overlaying the edges of what I call the \"main content area\". If this is off for your chronicle, then you have to correct this for your runs. You can do this by adding an additional parameter <code>-offset-x &lt;value&gt;</code> (or short: <code>-x &lt;value&gt;</code> to your call. If the green box is larger than the main area, use positive values, e.g. <code>-x 10</code>. If the green box is smaller than the main area, try negative values, e.g. <code>-x -10</code>. Might take some trying around until you got a working value, but finally it should hopefully work. Then you can use that same value when filling out your chronicle. This parameter is supported both for the <code>fill</code> and for the <code>batch fill</code> command.</p> Only values in the right sidebar (xp, credits/gold, ...) are misplaced <p>Chronicles for different scenarios might have sidebars with a different size and thus need some minor adaptions to the template configuration. First check whether there already exists a specialized template for your scenario (<code>pfscf template list</code>) and try using that one. If this does not help, you could either try to fix the configuration yourself or send me the chronicle via email and I will see what I can do.</p> The CSV file that I generated with pfscf does not properly work with Excel/LibreOffice, ... <p>Applications like Excel try to put the content from such a file into a table based on so-called separator characters. And although CSV stands for \"comma-separated values\", some applications do not follow the CSV standard, and use a different separator. Apparently Excel has certain expectations on what the separator character is, based on the region that you're living in. Specifically some regions use a semi-colon (;), instead. The CSV files generated from pfscf are using <code>,</code> as separator character per the CSV standard. When generating a CSV file with pfscf, you can select what should be used as separator using the <code>--separator</code> command line flag, e.g. <code>pfscf batch create --separator \";\" ...</code>. Please check whether everything works then as expected. Soon I will also provide means to store this in a config so that you don't have to specify this each and every time when generating a CSV file.</p> When I use pfscf with some PDF file, it keeps complaining that some operation is not allowed because of PDF permissions on that file. <p>The permission settings in place on Paizos PDFs do not allow to do things like extracting pages. Which I can totally understand for the scenario and their property in general, but this makes life a little bit harder. Have a look at the chapter about getting blank chronicle sheets for instructions on how to extract a chronicle sheet from your scenario PDF file that should work with pfscf.</p> Oh noes! I have found a bug! I HAVE FOUND A BUG!!1! <p>First, calm down. Second, please report this to me by opening an issue. If you do so, please provide as many details as possible. What operating system are you running? What did you do (exact command line, input files), what did then happen (exact output)? I will try to find out what can be done about this and try to fix it as soon as possible.</p>"},{"location":"usage/","title":"Filling Out Chronicles","text":""},{"location":"usage/#quickstart","title":"Quickstart","text":"<p>There is a quickstart chapter available if you want to dive right in and get some quick results.</p>"},{"location":"usage/#filling-out-a-single-chronicle","title":"Filling Out a Single Chronicle","text":"<p>To fill out a chronicle, you will basically need to things to start:</p> <ol> <li>The ID of the template to use for filling the chronicle.
