This program is being developed as private hobby. Although this program is intended to be used with chronicles for 
organized play from Paizo, I am in no way associated with Paizo Inc. Also, you're using this program at your own

and the like done by using this program. I cannot guarantee that the program is free of bugs (on the contrary, I am 
pretty sure that there is a sufficient number of bugs still included), and if I am made aware of a problem, I won't 
guarantee on a timeline until when that bug will be fixed.
